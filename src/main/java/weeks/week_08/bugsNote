    In addition, we'll find the bug(s) at the simplified version of the pizza application that you created with Ozzy during Java Labs
    As you already know, a customer should be able to log in before ordering a pizza with this application.
    Please check them before our meeting using debugging and be ready to explain them at our meeting.

    - Bug is in Line 36 -> break is replaced with continue;
    - BUG Description -> When user enters true credentials and logs in -> Programme continues to ask enter email again and again...

    - Bug is in Line 63 -> 'return false' is replaced with 'return true';
    - BUG Description -> When user enters NEGATIVE credentials and tries to log in "Missing (.) dot in email OR @ comes after ."
                      -> Programme doesnt validate EMAIL as expected
                      -> For example mike@gmailcom returns VALID, mike.gmail@com also returns VALID by mistake...

    - Bug is in Line 73 -> 'gmail' replaced with 'gail' -> TYPO
    - BUG Description -> When user enters POSITIVE credentials and tries to log in,
                      -> Programme doesn't validate EMAIL as expected because of TYPO in Line 83 -> gail instead of gmail...
                      -> mike@gmailcom is true but gives error
