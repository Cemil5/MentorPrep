/*
Write a method which prints out the numbers from 1 to 100 but for numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FINRA" instead of the number,  for numbers which are a multiple of 3, print "FIN" instead of the number and for numbers which are a multiple of 5, print "RA" instead of the number.

    ex:
        output:
            1 2 FIN 4 RA FIN 7 8 FIN RA 11 FIN 13 14 FINRA 16 17 FIN


3. write a program that can calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 to any given number
            ex:
                input: 100
                output: 5050

                input: 50
                output: 1275


4. Write a program that can return the factorial number of any given number

            Ex:
                input: 5
                output: 120

                	( because: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2* 1 = 120 )


5. write a program that can retive the digits, letters and special characters from a string
            Ex:
                input:
                    mn@#123Ab!

                output:
                    letters: mnAb
                    digits: 123
                    special chars: @#!

6. Write a program that can return the sum of digits from a  string
             Ex:
                 input: A1B2C3

                 output:    6

             Hint: You need to get each of the character by using a loop
	             	To convert char to number:
						             	   '0' - 48   ==> 0
						             	   '1' - 48   ==> 1

7. Write a program that can check if the given String is palindrome

			Ex:
				input:
					Level

				output:
					true


				input:
					Anna

				output:
					true


Write a program that can remove the duplicated characters from the string

                Ex:
                    str = "aabbbcccc"

                    output:
                        abc
